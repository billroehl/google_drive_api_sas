INTRODUCTION

Our organization has been utilizing Google Drive (previously Google Docs) to keep project documentation centrally         located for ease of access by any user on any platform. Up to this point, SAS® developers had to manually import or export data sets to or from flat files or Microsoft Excel in order to update data stored in the cloud. This paper provides a powerful macro toolkit that facilitates direct access to Google Spreadsheets through its published API, allowing uploading, downloading, deletion, and live data manipulation of cloud-based data. This provides an opportunity for a significant reduction in the amount of manual work and time required for SAS developers to perform these basic functions. Code was developed with SAS 9.3 and HTMLTidy (25MAR2009) running under Microsoft Windows 7.
